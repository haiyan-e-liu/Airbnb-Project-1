You will need the standard data science libraries found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name = "motivation"></a>
In this project, I aim to answer three business questions regarding house/apartment listsing on Airbnb in Seattle, WA, US: 
1. How has Airbnb listing price on average changed over time, both across years and within a single year? 
2. How long are the houses listed on Airbnb a year and how has that changed over time? This question allows us to tell whether there are any landlords that list their houses on Airbnb fulltime. 
3. How are the prices differ across region (neighborhood and zipcode)? Which zipcodes are the most expensive?
